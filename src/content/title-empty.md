## Issue
Empty page title

```
<head>
    <title></title>
</head>
```

## Why is it a problem
The page title is the first thing announced by screen readers (and some other assistive technologies) and is therefore an important wayfinding cue.


## How to fix it
Add a title that is clear, informative, unique, and concise.

```
<head>
    <title>Buying or selling your home - GOV.UK</title>
</head>
```
