<p class="contrast-fail">This text has insufficent contrast against the background colour</p>

## Issue
Insufficient contrast between text and its background

## Why is it a problem
People with moderately low vision will not be able to read the text

## How to fix it
Change the background or text colour so that contrast ratio is at least 4.5:1 for small text (less than 18px) and 3:1 for large text (greater than 18px).
