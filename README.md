* Create a page for each issue with an example of the issue
* Test each issue with Tenon, WAVE, BBC Accessibility Standards Checker, Accessibility Developer Tools and capture if the tool finds the issue
* Explain who the issue affects
* Show how to fix the issue

## To do

* Write a wave api client and set up grunt to test each page with Wave API
* Set up BBC Accessibility Standards Checker
* Add 1 issue every day - categorise it, add it's WCAG details and test it!
* Write a blog post about the site
